# Part 2
### a) How many pokemon are there? Show your grep that you used to get to that number.
answer: 15
in the captured directory: ls | ggrep -v "instruction.txt" | wc -l
- list the files in the captured directory, returns lines excluding instructions.txt, count the number of lines


### b) Who are the three biggest pokemon? (number of lines) Show the grep that you used to get to the result.
answer: charizard, beedrill, pikachu
in the captured directory: ggrep "" -r -c
- searches through the captured directory, shows number of lines in each file that match empty pattern,
which will just return the number of lines
